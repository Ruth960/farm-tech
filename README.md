## FarmConnect _Mobile Version
FarmConnect is a platform that bridges the gap between small-scale farmers and buyers, allowing farmers without internet access to sell their produce at fair prices through mobile-based listings. The system will initially be built as a web-based platform with future plans for a mobile app.

Provide an SMS-based verification system for onboarding.
